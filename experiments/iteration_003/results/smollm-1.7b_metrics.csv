Solution:

Let the...","There are a total of 20 single-page spreads * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 double-page spreads.
As these are made up of 2 pages each, there are 40 double-page spreads * 2 pages = <<40*2=80>>80 pages in the double-page spreads.
In total, there are 20 single-pages + 80 double-pages = <<20+80=100>>100 pages in the spreads.
A block of ads is printed every 4 pages, so there will be 100 pages / 4 pages/block = <<100/4=25>>25 blocks of ads.
This is a total of 25 blocks * 4 ads = <<25*4=100>>100 ads.
As each ad takes up a quarter of a page, this must create an additional 100 ads * 0.25 = <<100*0.25=25>>25 pages.
Therefore, the press has printed 100 pages from the spreads + 25 pages of ads = <<100+25=125>>125 pages.

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get s + 8s + 13 = 130

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify the given information:
Luna's monthl...","Let x be Luna's house rental budget.
The total budget for house and food rental is represented by the equation x + (60x/100) = 240.
The equation becomes 100x + 60x = 24000 after multiplying each term by 100 to get rid of the fraction.
By combining like terms, the equation becomes 160x = 24000.
Thus, the value of x is 24000/160 = <<24000/160=150>>150 which represents the house rental budget.
So, Luna's food budget is $240 - $150 = $<<240-150=90>>90.
Her phone bill budget is $90 x 10/100 = $<<90*10/100=9>>9.
Therefore, Luna's monthly budget for all those expenses is $240 (house and food) + $9 (phone) = $<<240+9=249>>249.
