The total money they all have is $7 + $8 = $<<7+8=15>>15.
There will be 1 (Carmela) + 4 (cousins) = <<1+4=5>>5 people who will be sharing equally the money.
So each of them should get $15/5 = $<<15/5=3>>3.
Hence, Carmela has to give a total of $7 - $3 = $<<7-3=4>>4 to her 4 cousins.
Therefore, each of her cousins will get $4/4 = $<<4/4=1>>1.
