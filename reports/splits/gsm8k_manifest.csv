How long does it take James to run 100 meters?,"John runs 100-4=<<100-4=96>>96 meters once he reaches his max speed
He runs it in 13-1=<<13-1=12>>12 seconds
So he runs at a speed of 96/12=<<96/12=8>>8 m/s
So that means James's top speed is 8+2=<<8+2=10>>10 m/s
He has to run 100-10=<<100-10=90>>90 meters at his top speed
So he runs that at 90/10=<<90/10=9>>9 seconds
So he takes 9+2=<<9+2=11>>11 seconds to run 100 meters
