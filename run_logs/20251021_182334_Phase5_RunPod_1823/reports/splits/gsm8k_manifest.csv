gsm8k_2,"Flora has been experiencing frequent fractures. Dr. Juan has asked her to strengthen her bones by drinking 105 gallons of milk within 3 weeks. Flora thinks that drinking 3 gallons of milk daily will be enough, but her brother says she'll still need to drink more. To fulfill Dr. Juan’s requirement, how many more gallons must Flora drink daily?","3 weeks translate to 3 * 7 days = <<3*7=21>>21 days.
To meet Dr. Juan’s recommendation would mean drinking 105/21 = <<105/21=5>>5 gallons daily.
This means that Flora must drink 5 -3 = <<5-3=2>>2 more gallons daily.

gsm8k_3,Each dandelion produces 300 seeds. 1/3rd of the seeds land in water and die. 1/6 of the starting number are eaten by insects. Half the remainder sprout and are immediately eaten. How many dandelions survive long enough to flower?,"First find the number of seeds that land in water: 300 seeds * 1/3 = <<300*1/3=100>>100 seeds
Then find the number of seeds that are eaten: 300 seeds * 1/6 = <<300*1/6=50>>50 seeds
Subtract the number of seeds that are destroyed to find the number that sprout: 300 seeds - 100 seeds - 50 seeds = <<300-100-50=150>>150 seeds
Then divide that number by 2 to find the number of sprouts that survive: 150 seeds / 2 = <<150/2=75>>75 seeds

gsm8k_4,"Cameron drives at twice the speed of his brother, Chase.  But Danielle drives at three times the speed of Cameron.  If it takes Danielle 30 minutes to travel from Granville to Salisbury, how long, in minutes, will it take Chase to travel from Granville to Salisbury?","If Danielle drives at three times the speed of Cameron, it will take Cameron 30*3=<<30*3=90>>90 minutes for Cameron to travel the same distance.
And since Cameron drives at twice the speed of his brother, Chase, it will take Chase 90*2=<<90*2=180>>180 minutes to travel from Granville to Salisbury.

gsm8k_6,"Tabitha adds 1 serving of honey per cup of tea in the evening.  She usually has 2 cups of tea before bed.  She buys her honey in a 16-ounce container.  If there are 6 servings of honey per ounce, how many nights will she be able to enjoy honey in her tea before bed?","She has 1 serving of honey per cup of tea and she has 2 teas at night so she needs a total of 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 servings per night
There are 6 servings in 1 ounce and she has a 16-ounce jar of honey so that's 6*16 = <<6*16=96>>96 servings of honey

gsm8k_7,"Violet is planning a hike through the desert with her dog. Violet needs 800 ml of water per hour hiked and her dog needs 400 ml of water per hour. If Violet can carry 4.8 L of water, how many hours can she and her dog spend hiking?","First find the total amount of water Violet and her dog consume per hour: 800 ml + 400 ml = <<800+400=1200>>1200 ml
Then divide that amount by 1000 ml/L to convert it to liters: 1200 ml / 1000 ml/L = <<1200/1000=1.2>>1.2 L
Then divide Violet's carrying capacity by the amount of water they drink per hour to find how many hours she can hike: 4.8 L / 1.2 L/hour = 4 hours
