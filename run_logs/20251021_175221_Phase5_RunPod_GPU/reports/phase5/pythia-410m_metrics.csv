**Step 2:*...","Jack is able to carry two 5-gallon buckets of water per trip, or 2 * 5 = 10 gallons of water. Jill can only carry one bucket per trip, or 5 gallons.
Jack completes 3 trips to the well and back for every 2 trips Jill completes, so in that time they have both together carried 3 Jack trips * 2 buckets per Jack trip * 5 gallons per bucket + 2 Jill trips * 1 bucket per Jill trip * 5 gallons per bucket = 30 gallons + 10 gallons = <<3*2*5+2*1*5=40>>40 gallons of water.
If you consider these as a single ""group"" of trips, it will take 600 gallons / 40 gallons per ""group"" of trips = <<600/40=15>>15 groups of trips.

This is ...","First, find the total number of blocks south Janet is from her starting point by subtracting the blocks she walked north from the blocks she walked south: 8 blocks - 3 blocks = <<8-3=5>>5 blocks
Then find the number blocks she walked west: 3 blocks * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 blocks
Then find the number of blocks she walked east: 8 blocks * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 blocks
Subtract the number of blocks she walked east from the number of blocks she walked west to find how many blocks west of her starting point she is: 21 blocks - 16 blocks = <<21-16=5>>5 blocks
Add the number of blocks she needs to walk north to the number of blocks she needs to walk east: 5 blocks + 5 blocks = <<5+5=10>>10 blocks
Finally, divide the distance she needs to walk by her speed to find how long she'll spend walking: 10 blocks / 2 blocks/minute = <<10/2=5>>5 minutes

The sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25
The square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is √25=5 inches.

Converting this time into minutes shows that getting to the train took 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = <<2*60=120>>120 minutes.
Waiting for the train to arrive took twice as long as his walk, so 15 minutes * 2 = <<15*2=30>>30 minutes.
This means that his bus ride must have taken 120 minutes – 30 minutes - 15 minutes = <<120-30-15=75>>75 minutes.
